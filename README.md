# TitanicEDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The goal is to understand the data through statistics and visualizations, identify trends and patterns, and make basic feature-level inferences.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Key features include:

* `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`

## Project Tasks

1. Generate Summary Statistics

2. Create Histograms and Boxplots

3. Explore Feature Relationships

4. Identify Patterns and Trends

5. Make Feature-Level Inferences

## Output

* Statistical summary of the dataset
* Histograms and boxplots for key features
* Heatmap of correlation matrix
* Visualizations showing survival trends
* Observations and insights based on the data
